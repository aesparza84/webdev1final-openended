            <p>As the war progressed, the same companies that provided early-war aircraft continued to develop and design more models. New generation after new generation would
               continue to replace the old ones, and would allow the U.S. to have air superiority.

Improvements on the engine made it one of the fastest US warplanes at the time. However, the plane entered service as the war was coming to a close and never really got a chance at combat.

                      fighter bomber and ground attacker. It used the same engine as the F6F and F4U with a turbocharger that boosted its performance.

                      African Americans flew these under the Red Tails. Produced by the U.S. to give to Britain, this would replace the P40 as they proved superior in every department.
